## Machine Learning project applied to make investing easier to understand for newbies.

### 1. Investing ratios webscrapping. 
We have scrapped with beautifoulSoup investing data related to the companies selected from NYSE market. 

### 2. Dataset creation.
We have randomly simulated 500.000 investments in the last 10 years with a horizon between 1 day and 2 years.  The dataset has been cleaned and prepared for machine-learning modelling by applying categorization or normalization techniques among others. Resulting dataset has been saved into 'datasets/transactions_variables.csv' if you want to use it. 

### 3. Data Modelling and optimization.
